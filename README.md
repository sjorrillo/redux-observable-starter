# Redux Observable Starter

This is an starter project with my preferred setup of ESLint, Prettier, and a bunch of libraries.


## Setup

After cloning this repo, do the following:
 
Run `yarn`. This will make sure that all of the dependencies are installed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

#### `yarn lint`

Verifies all the linting and prettier rules and report it in a friendly report. Additional there is `yarn lint:fix` which tries to fix all the broke rules.

#### `yarn test`

Run all the tests available at least a path to file is provided.


#### `yarn build:client`

Prepare the bundles for production environments.

## RxJS

The `RxJS` folder are exercises for learning purposes. Feel free to remove that folder
